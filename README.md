### About Me:    
I'm a passionate software engineer with a knack for game development, specializing in multiplayer games and AWS lambda functions.

Currently, I'm delving into the realms of web3 and building a PVP multiplayer platform, where I'm actively engaged in crafting and analyzing smart contracts, vertically and horizontally scalable game servers.
